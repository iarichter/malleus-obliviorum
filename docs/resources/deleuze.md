# Minoritization (Deleuze and Guattari)
(generated by ChatGPT 2024-11)
The concept of **minoritization** in the work of **Deleuze and Guattari**, particularly in *A Thousand Plateaus*, refers to a dynamic process rather than a fixed identity. It describes a way of becoming that resists dominant structures and norms, challenging the majoritarian, hegemonic frameworks of identity and representation.

## Key Ideas of Minoritization

1. **Not about numerical minorities**:  
   Minoritization is not about being a statistical minority (e.g., a smaller group compared to a majority). Instead, it’s about occupying a position that deviates from or resists the dominant, normative "major" frameworks.

2. **Becoming-minoritarian**:  
   This is a process of transformation where one moves away from the standardizing, homogenizing forces of the "major" (e.g., dominant cultural, linguistic, or societal norms). It’s a creative act of difference and divergence, opening up new ways of thinking, being, and relating.

3. **Majority and Power**:  
   For Deleuze and Guattari, the "major" represents the dominant system, often tied to norms like whiteness, maleness, or heterosexuality in Western contexts. These norms claim universality and enforce conformity.

4. **Political and Aesthetic Resistance**:  
   Minoritization is deeply political and aesthetic. It often involves marginalized groups creating alternative modes of expression, art, and life. For example, literature, music, or other forms of cultural production by marginalized communities embody this process.

5. **Deterritorialization**:  
   Minoritization connects with their broader concept of **deterritorialization**—escaping or destabilizing fixed structures to create new, fluid territories of meaning and existence.

## Example
In literature, Kafka's use of German in his writing is a classic example they discuss. Although German was a "major" language, Kafka’s use of it as a Czech Jew in Prague transformed it into something minoritarian—subverting and reworking its norms to articulate marginalized experiences.

Ultimately, **minoritization** is a way of thinking about resistance, creativity, and transformation that refuses static categories and embraces fluid, dynamic processes of becoming.
