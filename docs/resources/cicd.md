CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery or deployment. It's a series of practices that help software development teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably:
Continuous integration (CI): Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, where automated builds and tests run. This helps identify issues early.
Continuous delivery (CD): Automatically deploys code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.
