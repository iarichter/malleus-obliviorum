The "CODE" method by Tiago Forte is a structured approach to building a “second brain” through effective note-taking and digital organization. It stands for **Capture**, **Organize**, **Distill**, and **Express** and is designed to make knowledge more accessible and useful.

* **Capture**: Keep what's useful and resonates with you
    * What are the recurring themes and questions that I always seem to return to in my work and life?
    * What insightful, high-value, impactful information do I already have access to that could be valuable?
    * Which knowledge do I want to interconnect, mix and match, and periodically resurface to stimulate future thinking on these subjects
* **Organize**: Save information for actionability
    * Extract the most valuable pieces of information from what you've captured. This means condensing content to essential takeaways and highlighting the insights most relevant to you. The idea is to reduce cognitive load when reviewing notes and focus on what matters most.
* **Distill**: Find the essence of an idea to communicate it more effectively
* **Express**: Use your second brain to combine knowledge and create something new
