The acronym "CODE" is a four-step method developed by Tiago Forte to help build a second brain:
* Capture: Keep what's useful and resonates with you
  * What are the recurring themes and questions that I always seem to return to in my work and life?
  * What insightful, high-value, impactful information do I already have access to that could be valuable?
  * Which knowledge do I want to interconnect, mix and match, and periodically resurface to stimulate future thinking on these subjects
* Organize: Save information for actionability
  * Text
* Distill: Find the essence of an idea to communicate it more effectively
* Express: Use your second brain to combine knowledge and create something new
