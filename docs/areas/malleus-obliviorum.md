# malleus obliviorum
### What's in a name?
*Malleus Obliviorum* can be understood as latin for: *The Hammer of Forgetfulness*.

As a person with ADHD, a tool that can "destroy" forgetfulness is highly desirable, and something I've been trying to build for a long time. Also, everyone knows that a pretentious latin name is fun and makes you sound fancy.

The goal is for this to be something of a "zettelkasten" or "second brain", but in my own way, and in my own style. And while the whole will never be complete, this format allows for small slices of creativey and action to be published and thus considered ['done'](../resources/cult-of-done.md).   

### caveat
It is worth acknowledging that the [*Malleus Maleficarum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum) (from which this name takes inspiration) was a notorious book on witchcraft from the 15th century. There is some debate still on the actual impact of the treatise as it was never adopted officially by the Catholic Inquisition, regardless, it represents a fearful and patriarchal engagement with the (unfamiliar) supernatural world. Rather than an affirmation of such a regressive worldview, it is my goal for this tool to be a holistic and inclusive resource.
