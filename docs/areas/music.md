## listening
I'm a musical omnivore and love making making playlists for all vibes, seasons, and situations. 
#### Last.fm
* I started seriously tracking my listening with Last.fm in 2018 and [my profile](https://www.last.fm/user/eng3en) is getting close to that 200k scrobbles mark.
* I've also made a couple HTML pages for sharing Last.fm listening with friends/family. [Details here](../projects/lastfm.md). 

## my stuff
* DJ Mixes:
    * [Nightcap](https://soundcloud.com/iarichter/mixology-6-nightcap?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing&si=edf54fc51a164513bff7f6beac4f427c) (A fairly stupid yet fun hip-hop/party/bass music mix that I slapped together in an evening)
    * [Going West](https://soundcloud.com/iarichter/goingwest) (Western themed mix. Way too high concept but I love it.)
    * [Advent](https://soundcloud.com/iarichter/mixology-7-advent) (A musical journey of despair, depression and hope that evokes my own experiences around the Advent season.)
    * Older mixes: I think they're buried in my Google Drive somewhere. I should post those somewhere...TBD
* Remixes:
