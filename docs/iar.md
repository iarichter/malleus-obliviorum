## meta-about
I am a builder. I like to make things and make things better. It's probably why I made this whole site.  

I'm also highly conceptual and systematic. It's probably why I got my MLIS. Who else is figuring out how to organize all the details of the world but librarians?

So what's better than building [something](./images/lego-spaceship-i-built-one-holiday-out-of-spare-parts.png)? Building a [process](./projects/snow-jira.md). Building a [system](kbindex.md). It's probably why I work in tech.
