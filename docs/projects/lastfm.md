## Who:
A group of people who want to keep up with what everyoe is listening to. 
## What:
A way to see everyone's recent scrobbles in one view. A single webpage that displays multiple user's info.
## Why:
Music is better when shared. As we all live more of our lives digitally and as friends move across the country, staying connected is even more a priority.
