# design
* I want to have my initials as a PNG with transparent background centered, then scroll down slightly to have maybe a couple boxes cover it?
* also I really like the idea of a monospaced serif font
* introductory text should be minimal:
    * hello, you've found my little corner of the Internet. 
    * list projects that I have repos for? Spotify playlist, maybe some SharePoint powershell scripts? how could I demonstrate my work on the Snow<>Jira integration?
    * ohhh maybe I could format each project as almost a super light agile documentation example using the who what why to describe and then describe/show results. any code could be linked 
# to do
* more project pages
    * SNOW<>JIRA integration
    * sharepoint shenanigans
        * custom list stuff
        * PNP search
* I need visuals for my project pages!
    * Spotify: script running gif
