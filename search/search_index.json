The title reflects their opposition to the Freudian framework, which they saw as reductive and repressive, particularly in how it ties desire to familial structures. Here's an outline of their critique and alternative:</p> <p>Why \"Anti-Oedipus\"?</p> <ol> <li>Critique of the Oedipus Complex:</li> </ol> <p>The Oedipus complex frames desire through a familial triangle (mother, father, child), which Deleuze and Guattari argue imposes a narrow, culturally specific narrative onto universal human experiences.</p> <p>They see this model as a form of repression, channeling the complexity of desire into a moralistic and restrictive framework that serves societal control.</p> <ol> <li>Psychoanalysis as a Tool of Control:</li> </ol> <p>They argue that psychoanalysis reinforces capitalist and patriarchal systems by individualizing problems and pathologizing deviations from \"normal\" family structures.</p> <p>The focus on the nuclear family distracts from broader social, political, and economic forces shaping subjectivity.</p> <ol> <li>Desire as Productive and Social:</li> </ol> <p>For Deleuze and Guattari, desire is not a lack (as Freud posits) but a productive, creative force that operates beyond familial or individual confines.</p> <p>Their Alternative: Schizoanalysis</p> <ol> <li>Desiring-Machines:</li> </ol> <p>They propose the concept of \"desiring-machines\" to describe how desire functions as a process of connection, flow, and production. Desire operates through assemblages, linking various entities, materials, and forces.</p> <p>These \"machines\" are not confined to individual psyches but are part of broader social and material systems.</p> <ol> <li>Anti-repressive Approach:</li> </ol> <p>Schizoanalysis seeks to free desire from the confines of Oedipal and capitalist structures, allowing it to flow more freely and express itself creatively.</p> <ol> <li>The Body Without Organs (BwO):</li> </ol> <p>They introduce the concept of the BwO, a metaphor for a body that resists hierarchical organization and embraces a fluid, dynamic state. It is a way of thinking about desire, subjectivity, and creativity outside fixed identities or roles.</p> <ol> <li>Political Dimension of Desire:</li> </ol> <p>Desire is inherently political. They argue that capitalist systems exploit and channel desire into consumerism and conformity. Schizoanalysis aims to uncover these processes and create new ways of being.</p> <ol> <li>Schizophrenia as a Model:</li> </ol> <p>They use schizophrenia metaphorically (not as a clinical condition) to describe a way of being that resists fixed identities and embraces multiplicity, flow, and creativity. It serves as a counterpoint to the rigid, hierarchical structures imposed by Oedipal and capitalist frameworks.</p> <p>Key Takeaways:</p> <p>Anti-Oedipus is an attempt to dismantle psychoanalytic and societal frameworks that reduce human desire to narrow, repressive models. Deleuze and Guattari advocate for an expansive, productive understanding of desire that emphasizes freedom, creativity, and connection to broader social forces. Schizoanalysis, their proposed alternative, seeks to uncover and unleash these possibilities.</p>"},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/","title":"markdown and mkdocs notes","text":"","tags":["documentation"]},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/#markdown-and-mkdocs-notes","title":"Markdown and Mkdocs notes","text":"","tags":["documentation"]},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/#quick-reference-external","title":"quick reference (external)","text":"<ul> <li>Mkdocs user guide </li> <li>Material for Mkdocs reference</li> <li>Markdown Guides:<ul> <li>Basic Syntax</li> <li>Extended Syntax</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["documentation"]},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/#local-server-for-dev-work","title":"local server for dev work","text":"run terminal at root folder (./GitHub/malleus-obliviorum)<pre><code>.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\npython -m mkdocs serve\n</code></pre>","tags":["documentation"]},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/#cli-git-process","title":"CLI git process","text":"add, commit, and push<pre><code>git add .\ngit commit -m \"Your commit message here\"\ngit push origin main\n::\n:: OR...just use the bat file I made\n::\ncommitToGitHub.bat 'commitYour commit message here' \n</code></pre>","tags":["documentation"]},{"location":"resources/mkdocs-material/#deploying-to-github","title":"deploying to GitHub","text":"<p>All handled by GitHub actions with current set up.
